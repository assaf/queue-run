# WebSocket

WebSockets keep an open connection between the browser and the server.

They allow you to do many interesting things:

* Low latency communication, eg sending changes to the server to save as you type
* Update multiple users at once in real time, eg chat rooms and collaborative editing
* Update multiple devices at once for the same user, eg sync desktop and mobile
* Update the user when a long running task completes, eg a queued job
* Track which users are currently online, aka "presence"

WebSocket make that possible by allowing you to send a message to the client at any time, during an HTTP/WebSocket request, or from a queued or scheduled job.

You can send messages to specific users, for example, all members of a chat room, or all users actively editing a document.


## Request Handlers

The simplest way to handle WebSocket requests it to create a file `socket/index.ts` and export the WebSocket request handler.

For example:

```ts title=socket/index.md
import { socket } from "queue-run";

export default async function({ data }) {
  console.log("Message from client: %o", data);
  await socket.send({ reply: "ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!" });
}
```

The request handler receives a single argument with the properties:

- `connection` â€” The connection ID for this WebSocket
- `data` â€” The request is either a JavaScript object (JSON), string, or `Buffer`
- `requestId` - Unique request ID
- `user` â€” User object returned from the [authenticate](#authentication) middleware

Since JSON is the most common use case, this is also the default. If you want to receive the raw text string, use `export const config = { type: "string" };`. To receive the raw `Buffer`, set `type: "binary"`;

Clients can still connect and you can send them messages.

If the request handler throws any error, or the request times out, the server sends back a JSON object of the form `{ error: string }`. That error is also logged by the [Logging Middleware](#logging-middleware).

You can change the timeout using `export const config = { timeout: inSeconds };`.


## Sending Messages

You can use `socket.send(message)` to send a message.

The sent message can be any of:

- `any object` â€” Respond with a JSON document
- `Buffer` â€” Respond with binary content
- `string` â€” Respond with string

If the user is authenticated, it will send a message to that user, on all devices that have an open WebSocket connection.

This works in HTTP and WebSocket request handlers, as well as queued jobs.

You can also send a message to specific user, or up to 100 users, using `socket.to(userIDs).send(message)`. This works everywhere, including scheduled jobs.

```ts title=queues/chat_message.ts
export default async function({ roomId, message }) {
  ...
  const room = await db.rooms.findOne({ id: roomId });
  if (!room) return;
  await socket
    .to(room.members)
    .send({ event: 'message', message });
} 
```

If the user is not authenticated, you can still send them a message from within the WebSocket request handler using `socket.send`. It will only arrive on the currently connected device.

The `socket.send` method is generic, so you can apply type checking for messages:

```ts
await socket.send<{ update: 'profile '}>({ update: 'profile', profile });
```

:::tip Await and Errors

It's a good practice to use `await` to make sure your code waits for the message to be sent.

If you don't care for errors, you can do this:

```ts
await socket.push(message).catch(() => undefined);
```

## Authentication

To authenticate users, export the `authenticate` method from either `socket/index.ts` or `socket/_middleware.ts`. (`socket/_middleware.ts` is also used for [logging](#logging-middleware))

The `authenticate` method receives the HTTP request for opening a WebSocket connection, so has access to the HTTP headers (eg `Authentication`) and cookies.

Typically you use the same authentication for HTTP and WebSocket, so your middleware would look like:

```ts title=socket/_middleware.ts
export { authenticate } from '#api/_middleware.js';
```

From an HTTP/WebSocket request or queued job that's already authenticated, you can always send a message to the user with `socket.send(message)`.

:::info Why Authenticate?

Authentication allows you to send messages to the user across all their devices and from queued jobs. Without authentication, you only get request/response for WebSocket.

If users are not signed in, the browser can still create a unique identifier. This allows WebSocket to receive messages even after a reconnect, or reloading the page.

## Presence

If you want to track whether a user is online (has an active WebSocket connection):

* `onOnline(userId)` will be called when the user first connects, after they've been authenticated
* `onOffline(userId)` will be called when the last connection has closed
* `socket.isOnline(userID)` will return `true` if there's an open connection for that user

You can export `onOnline` and `onOffline` from `socket/index.ts` or `socket/_middleware.ts`.

You can combine that with WebSocket messages from the client to determine whether the user is active in a chat room, editing a document, etc.

For example:

```ts socket/[room]/action_enter.ts
export default async function({ data, user }) {
  await db.join({ roomId: data.room, userId: user.id });
}
```

```ts socket/_middleware.ts
export async function onOffline(userId) {
  await db.leaveAllRooms({ userId });
}
```


## Logging Middleware

WebSocket support the following logging middleware:

- `onMessageReceived(request)` â€” Called on every request
- `onMessageSent(message)` â€” Called for every message sent
- `onError(error, request)` â€” Called if the request handler or any middleware throws an error

The default middleware logs messages received and errors, but not messages sent.

You can change the middleware for any given route by exporting the functions you want to add, just like you export request handlers.

The most specific middleware is picked in this order:

- Middleware exported by the request handler file itself
- Middleware exported by `_middleware.ts` in the current directory
- The default middleware

If you don't want to use the default middleware, or disable middleware for one route, you can export `null`.

Your middleware can also wrap the default middleware.

For example:

```ts title=socket/_middleware.ts
export async function onMessageReceived({ connection, data }) {
  console.log('%s: <= %s', connection, data);
}

export async function onMessageSent({ connection, data }) {
  console.log('%s: => %s', connection, data);
}
```

:::note Middleware Context

* `onAuthenticate` is called once for every new connection before accepting the connection
* `onAuthenticate` is loaded from either `socket/index.ts` or `socket/_middleware.ts`
* `onMessageReceived` is called for every message received, loaded from the specific request, or from `socket/_middleware.ts`
* If the request handler responds, `onMessageSent` associated with that request handler is called
* For every other message sent, `onMessageSent` is called, loaded from either `socket/index.ts` or `socket/_middleware.ts`
