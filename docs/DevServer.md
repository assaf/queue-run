# Development Server

To run the development server:

```bash
npx queue-run dev
```

```
ðŸ‘‹ Dev server listening on:
   http://localhost:8000
   ws://localhost:8001
Î»: Compiled 10 files and copied 3 files
   Watching for changes (Crtl+R to reload) â€¦
```

The dev server lists on ports 8000 (HTTP) and 8001 (WebSocket). You can change the ports with the `--port` argument or `PORT` environment variable.

The server watches the current working directory and reloads whenever it detects a change.

It only watches over JavaScript, TypeScript and JSON files, and ignores `node_modules`. You can always force it to reload by pressing `Control+R`.

You can test queues directly by running (from a separate terminal window):

```bash
npx queue-run dev queue <queue-name> [body]
```

You can provide the body inline after the queue name, from a file (`@filename`), from stdin (`-`), or `queue-run` will prompt you.

If you're using a FIFO queue, you need to provide the group ID using the `--group` argument.

For example:

```bash
cat job.json
{ "id": 123 }
npx queue-run dev queue screenshots @job.json
```
