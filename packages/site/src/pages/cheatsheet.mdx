## Schedules

<Entry question="How do I run a scheduled job?">

- Add a file in the `schedules` directory
- The file name is the schedule name that will show in the console, logs, etc
- The default export is a function that will run on a schedule
- The named export `schedule` specifies when and how often to run the function
- Deploy

For example:

```ts title=schedules/daily_report.ts
export default async function() {
  // do some work here
}

export const schedule = "daily";
```

<Entry question="How do I schedule a job to run every X?">

You can use a [cron expression](https://crontab.guru):

- `"0 * * * *"` will run at minute 0 every hour
- `"0 0 * * *"` will run at midnight (UTC) every day
- `"0 7 * * 1"` will run at 7:00 AM (UTC) every Monday
- `"0 7 1 * *"` will run at 7:00 AM (UTC) on the first day of every month

You can also use common expressions like "every 15 minutes", "hourly", "every day at 17:00", etc.

<Entry question="Do scheduled jobs have a time limit?">

Yes. The default time limit is 5 minutes. However, if you schedule the job to run more frequently (eg every minute), the default timeout would be the time difference between each run.

You can export `config.timeout` to extend the timeout up to the limit of 15 minutes. However, for longer jobs, you may want to [use queues instead](schedules#retries-and-queues).

</Entry>

<Entry question="How do I now if the scheduled job ran on time?">

- `npx queue-run status` will show you each scheduled job, when it ran for the last time, and when it's expected to run again
- `npx queue-run metrics schedule <name> -r 90d` will show metrics for the last 90 days (you can use any other time range)
- `npx queue-run logs` will show you the server logs, with messages like `Job finished: name="daily" jobId="4b34115c-f94a-1c20-0a91-c4c22a9f436f"`

See [Monitoring & Visibility](monitoring) for more details.

<Entry question="How do I monitor my scheduled jobs?">

Monitoring should be separate from your backend so it's not subject to the same failure mode.

Recommend using a 3rd party service like [cronitor.io](https://cronitor.io) or [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io). See [Monitoring](schedules#monitoring) for more details.
