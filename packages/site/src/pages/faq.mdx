# FAQ

<Question question="How do I run a scheduled job?">

Adde a file in the `schedules` directory. The default export is the function you want to run on a schedule. The named export `schedule` specifies when and how often to run the function.

For example:

```ts title=schedules/daily_report.ts
export default async function() {
  // so some work here
}

export const schedule = "daily";
```

Deploy and then check that your schedule is enabled:

```bash
npx queue-run deploy
npx queue-run schedule
```

The `status` command will show when the scheduled job ran for the last time, and when it's expected to run next.
