# üêá QueueRun

Web 2.0 framework to make building back-ends and APIs easy and fun:

* HTTP APIs, WebSocket, FIFO queues, and (coming) scheduled jobs
* Focus on developer experience and simplicity
* Serverless: deploy and let it worry about scaling up/down 
* Made for the web: REST resources, Fetch API, HTML forms, console.log
* Batteries included: logging, authentication, custom domains, URL constructors
* No need to mess CloudFormation or edit YAML files
* TypeScript and ESM (JavaScript and CommonJS also supported)
